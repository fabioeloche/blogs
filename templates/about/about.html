                                    My name is Fabio, and if there's one thing I know, it's the quiet hum of anticipation the day before a Grand Slam. Right now, on the eve of Wimbledon, that feeling is electric.
                                </p>

                                    I grew up with the red clay of the Rome Masters practically under my fingernails, but for the last twelve years, my tennis home has been right here in Dublin. When I first moved here, I was struck by how the passion for tennis was just as fierce as it was back in Italy, even if it was discussed over a pint rather than an espresso.

                                    I started The Tennis Time because I wanted to create a space for that passion. A place for the Irish tennis community to connect, debate, and share in the drama that unfolds on courts around the world and right here at home. This blog is for the fan who appreciates a well-played point on a windy Saturday morning at a local club just as much as a Centre Court final.
